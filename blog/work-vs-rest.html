                <p>A very familiar story is one of Mary and Martha found in Luke 10:38-42. When Martha is working hard and preparing dinner while Mary is sitting and listening to Jesus. Martha complains to Jesus about it being unfair that she does all the work while Mary sits there. Jesus tells her in verses 41 and 42 that she is worried about all the details. There is only one thing to be concerned about and Mary has discovered it.</p>
                
                <p>This is an area, I have struggled with, and I think will continue to struggle with. How do I balance work and rest? And not just rest, but resting in God's presence, getting to know him as I let him in to know me. Yeah, he already knows everything anyway, but that is what I think makes it a relationship is getting to know each other. I don't really struggle much with work. It's more so the resting piece. One thing to catch in Jesus' response is that he doesn't say work is bad, he says that she's worried and concerned over the details. And that Mary's desire to sit and learn more about the teachings of Jesus was the only thing to be concerned about. I think it's a good illustration to what was recorded in Matthew 6 when Jesus is talking about worries, and that God will take care of our needs. If you look at Matthew 6:31-34, it paints the picture perfectly. 'Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. "Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.' This is the ESV. If you look at the NLT, instead of all these things will be added to you, it says he will give you everything you need.</p>
                
                <p>It's so easy to worry about all the problems and issues we go through. Even when life is good, it's easy to put off restful time with God. We need to be careful of being concerned with the wrong thing. One thing for me that's recent is that it's been tough being retrained at a job I used to do. I definitely have a great trainer, but there are moments it's been frustrating getting retaught the stuff I already know. I like learning the new stuff I need to know. Unless, I have questions, I'd rather be set loose then ask as I go. In reality, it's good to relearn the stuff I already know to build that foundation of the basics that I need to do the job well. I'm sure it's not the most perfect example that relates to what we're talking about, but just a real struggle I'm going through that I need to work on with God to find peace and being concerned with the right thing like showing Jesus' love to my co-workers, being intentional in getting to know them, and helping them at work in practical ways if I can.</p>
                
                <p>Quick recap. It's not bad to work, it's good to work. It all depends on where your focus is at. It's also good to get close with Jesus and listen to his teachings. Be concerned with the things of heaven and ask God to provide for your needs.</p>

                    <li>How can you find rest in Jesus within a busy work week?</li>
                    <li>What are you concerned about and how can you shift your concerns to God?</li>
