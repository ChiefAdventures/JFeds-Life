                <p>Man, I definitely have some things to learn from tournament bowling. Sometimes I think I tell myself the same stuff every tournament, maybe one day I'll listen lol.</p>
                
                <p>This tournament started out with a few splits in game 1 which hurt. I finished with a 169 that game then got my head out of my butt a little with shooting 222, 254, 232, 236 for a solid 944 (236 average) in the middle. I finished with a 170 for a total of 1283 for 6 which is a 213 average roughly. It's not that there's anything wrong with that, but I just couldn't see to finish a 10th frame well today or once I through a couple splits early and in the middle of the first and last game, I let that get in my head. Another piece is that these are ran with some handicap which means if you don't average 210, you can get 80% of those pins automatically included in your total. Thankfully it's not full 100% of 210, but either way I let that get in my head. I bowl scratch usually, so anytime there's a handicap tournament, I put this pressure on myself that I have to shoot out of my mind to make the cut in tournaments. In reality, if I just focus on my game and what I need to do, I'll be so much better off. The only I should be watching people is if I'm not throwing well and see how others are playing the lane.</p>
                
                <p>Like I said earlier, I'm sure one day what I tell myself will stick. I know I still have stuff in my game like mechanics and honestly probably reading a lane better, and I'm sure plenty of other stuff. I know I want to get more consistent. When I go do tournaments then I can walk in with more confidence. Low key thinking of looking into a coach, but I do watch a lot of YouTube which is sort of like getting coaching. It's tough when it's not always geared towards your bowling specifically though. We'll see what happens, I'll definitely keep tournaments and continue to work on my game as well. Next couple, if they work out with the schedule, are the 20th and 27th of December which are sport shots. That means it's a lot harder than a house pattern. You have to be way more accurate.</p>
                
                <p>Love you guys, God bless!<br>JFed</p>
