Well, I never thought I’d get in journaling/blogging/whatever you want to call this. I believe this is something that will not only help me, but hopefully help someone else as well. This piece is honestly inspired from listening to NF’s new album and his song Fear. Here are some of the lyrics that stuck out to me…

It's the same song and dance, you've all seen it before

Darkness holds out his hand, then we walk to the floor

Every decision made isn't mine anymore

Like a puppet with strings, I just don't have a choice

What's the truth? What's a lie?

Help me God, help me Lord

…

Lost the keys, lost my hope, lost my will, lost my joy

Lost a friend, lost my home, lost my faith, lost my voice

-NF 



I know I definitely go through seasons of life, and I would guess most of you do as well. Sometimes things are great, and other times not so great. Over time, I think it gets easier to recognize when we’re getting close to a good season or bad one. Li
