Man, I definitely have some things to learn from tournament bowling. Sometimes I think I tell myself the same stuff every tournament, maybe one day I’ll listen lol.



This tournament started out with a few splits in game 1 which hurt. I finished with a 169 that game then got my head out of my butt a little with shooting 222, 254, 232, 236 for a solid 944 (236 average) in the middle. I finished with a 170 for a total of 1283 for 6 which is a 213 average roughly. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with that, but I just couldn’t see to finish a 10th frame well today or once I through a couple splits early and in the middle of the first and last game, I let that get in my head. Another piece is that these are ran with some handicap which means if you don’t average 210, you can get 80% of those pins automatically included in your total. Thankfully it’s not full 100% of 210, but either way I let that get in my head. I bowl scratch usually, so anytime there’s a handicap tournament, I put this pressure on myself that I have to shoot out of my mind to make the cut in tournaments. In reality, if I just focus on my game and what I need to do, I’ll be so much
